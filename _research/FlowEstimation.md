Tumor perfusion and vascular properties are important determinants of cancer response to therapy and thus various approaches for imaging perfusion are being explored. The ultimate goal of this research is to introduce and translate a bedside, non-invasive approach to characterize complex tumor vascular properties by considering the interconnected nature of voxels in 3D dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound (DCE-US).

Joint project with Ahmed El Kaffas (UC San Diego) and Dimitre Hristov (Stanford University).
