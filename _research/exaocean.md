In the BMBF funded project ExaOcean we aim to accelerate the computation of the ICON-O ocean model, moving toward ExaScale. For this, we will use parallel spectral deferred correction methods, and combine classical numerical methods with machine learning (ML) approaches to include effects of sub-mesoscale eddies, which are not resolved on the computational mesh.
