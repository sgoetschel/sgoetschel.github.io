Together with a group at [Berkeley Lab](https://pfasst.lbl.gov/) I develop the [LibPFASST library](https://github.com/LibPFASST).

Member of the [Kaskade 7](https://www.zib.de/projects/kaskade7-finite-element-toolbox) developer team.

Code for lossy compression of finite element solutions is included in Kaskade 7.
Versions for use with [DUNE](http://www.dune-project.org/) and [deal.II](http://www.dealii.org/) are available on request.
